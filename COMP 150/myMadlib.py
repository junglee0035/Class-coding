The doorbell rings. You get up out of bed to see 
{person} at the door, holding a {single object}. 
{person} insists on going to {place} to go {action} 
with the {single object}. You and {person} head 
over to {place} but for some reason, a {animal} 
is chilling in the middle of traffic, watching {tv show}
on the new iPad pro. You and {person} beg the {animal} 
to get out of the way. The {animal} suggests that if {person} 
beats the {animal} in {game} then the {animal} will 
move. If {person} loses, then the world will end.
{person} wins with a landslide and the {animal} becomes 
impressed by {person}â€™s skills. The three of you go back 
to your place to chill, watch {tv show}, and eat {food}.

The End
